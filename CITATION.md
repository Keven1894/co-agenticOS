## 📖 Citing Key Concepts

### "Culture is the New Compiler"
```
As Guan (2025) states in the co-agenticOS Manifesto, "Culture is the new compiler. 
The clarity of shared intent and ethical reflection determines software quality 
more than any programming language or framework."
```

### Co-Agency Principle
```
The co-agenticOS framework introduces the concept of "co-agency," where "software 
is no longer authored by individuals alone [but] human creativity and agentic 
intelligence must act as partners, not hierarchies" (Guan, 2025).
```

### The Agentic Development Loop
```
Guan (2025) proposes the "Agentic Development Loop," a four-phase continuous 
process: Plan → Implement → Refactor → Summarize, forming what is called the 
"co-agentic flywheel."
```

### Human-AI Collaboration Patterns
```
The co-agenticOS framework demonstrates that AI agents can serve as institutional 
knowledge repositories, "breaking the hire-train-leave cycle" through vector 
database integration and systematic knowledge capture (Guan, 2025).
```

### LLM as Format Adapter
```
Guan (2025) introduces the novel application of Large Language Models as universal 
document format adapters, demonstrating that "LLMs excel at handling format 
variation—a problem that plagued traditional automation."
```
