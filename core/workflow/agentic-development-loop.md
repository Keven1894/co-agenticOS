# Agentic Development Loop
### The co-agenticOS Development Process

## Overview

The Agentic Development Loop is the core workflow of co-agenticOS, representing a continuous cycle of human-AI collaboration that forms the "co-agentic flywheel."

## The Four-Phase Loop

### 1. Plan Phase
**Duration:** 15-30 minutes  
**Participants:** Human engineers + Planning AI agent

#### Activities
- Review and prioritize issues from backlog
- AI drafts daily plan based on context and constraints
- Human engineers refine and approve the plan
- Assign specific tasks to AI agents
- Set success criteria and metrics

#### Deliverables
- Daily PLAN.md document
- AI agent assignments
- Success metrics and checkpoints

### 2. Implement Phase
**Duration:** 4-6 hours  
**Participants:** Human engineers + Code Generation AI agent

#### Activities
- Co-edit code in IDEs like Cursor
- AI generates code following established patterns
- Human engineers review and contextualize AI suggestions
- Continuous testing and validation
- Real-time documentation updates

#### Deliverables
- Working code implementation
- Test coverage
- Updated documentation
- Progress tracking

### 3. Refactor Phase
**Duration:** 30-60 minutes  
**Participants:** Human engineers + Review AI agent

#### Activities
- AI agents propose structural improvements
- Human engineers review and approve changes
- Code quality assessment
- Performance optimization suggestions
- Architecture decision documentation

#### Deliverables
- Refactored code
- Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
- Quality metrics
- Performance improvements

### 4. Summarize Phase
**Duration:** 15-30 minutes  
**Participants:** Human engineers + Documentation AI agent

#### Activities
- AI agents document daily changes automatically
- Generate comprehensive daily summary
- Reflect on collaboration effectiveness
- Plan next day's focus areas
- Update project documentation

#### Deliverables
- Daily Summary.md document
- Updated project documentation
- Collaboration insights
- Tomorrow's plan preview

## Continuous Improvement
