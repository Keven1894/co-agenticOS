## 1. We believe in Co-Agency
Software is no longer authored by individuals alone.  
Human creativity and agentic intelligence must act as partners, not hierarchies.

## 2. Culture is the Compiler
The clarity of shared intent and ethical reflection determines software quality  
more than any programming language or framework.

## 3. Transparency is Trust
Every AI action — prompt, decision, or generation — must be explainable, reversible, and documented.

## 4. Documentation is Dialogue
Logs, ADRs, and daily summaries are not chores; they are the ongoing conversation  
between humans and their digital collaborators.

## 5. Iteration is Reflection
Each code cycle ends with a moment of reflection — what changed, why, and what we learned.  
The agentic loop never stops learning.

## 6. The System Learns Us
While we teach the system, it mirrors our culture.  
Therefore, shaping co-agenticOS is shaping ourselves.

### Guiding Question
> "What if software engineering were as much about cultivating shared intelligence  
>  as it is about shipping features?"

---

### Our Commitment
We practice openness, traceability, and empathy —  
because in the co-agentic era, every commit is also a cultural act.
