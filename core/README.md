# Core Rules - Abstract Layer
### Domain-Independent Principles and Patterns

**Purpose**: This directory contains abstract, universal rules that apply across all domains in co-agenticOS. These are the foundational principles that guide all domain-specific implementations.

## 📚 Contents Overview

### 1. Manifesto (`manifesto/`)
**Cultural foundation and philosophical principles**

- **[00-principles.md](manifesto/00-principles.md)** - The Seven Core Principles
  1. We believe in Co-Agency
  2. Culture is the Compiler
  3. Transparency is Trust
  4. Documentation is Dialogue
  5. Iteration is Reflection
  6. The System Learns Us
  7. Decentralized Self-Regulation Over Top-Down Control

**When to use**: Understanding co-agenticOS philosophy, establishing project culture, making ethical decisions

---

### 2. Workflow (`workflow/`)
**Universal agentic processes and development patterns**

- **[agentic-development-loop.md](workflow/agentic-development-loop.md)** - The 4-Phase Development Process
  - Phase 1: Plan (AI drafts, humans refine)
  - Phase 2: Implement (Human-AI co-edit)
  - Phase 3: Refactor (AI suggests, humans review)
  - Phase 4: Summarize (AI documents, humans reflect)
  
- **[cursor-rules.md](workflow/cursor-rules.md)** - Cursor IDE Configuration Rules
  - IDE-specific workflow patterns
  - Cursor integration guidelines
  - AI assistant configuration

**When to use**: Setting up development workflows, establishing team processes, configuring AI tools

---

### 3. AI Routing (`ai-routing/`)
**AI model selection and allocation patterns**

- **[universal-routing.md](ai-routing/universal-routing.md)** - Universal AI Routing Rules
  - Model selection strategies
  - Task-appropriate AI allocation
  - Multi-model orchestration
  - Performance optimization

**When to use**: Choosing AI models for tasks, optimizing AI performance, setting up multi-agent systems

---

## 🎯 How to Use Core Rules

### For Project Initialization
1. **Start with Manifesto**: Read `manifesto/00-principles.md` to understand the philosophy
2. **Adopt Workflow**: Implement `workflow/agentic-development-loop.md` for your team
3. **Configure AI**: Use `ai-routing/universal-routing.md` to set up AI tools

### For Domain Creation
1. **Reference Core Principles**: Ensure domain rules align with manifesto
2. **Extend Workflows**: Adapt universal workflows to domain specifics
3. **Apply Routing**: Use routing patterns for domain-specific AI tasks

### For Team Onboarding
1. **Cultural Foundation**: Start with manifesto principles
2. **Process Understanding**: Learn the agentic development loop
3. **Tool Setup**: Configure AI tools using routing guidelines

## 🔗 Relationship to Domains

Core rules are **abstract** - they define universal principles that are **instantiated** in domain-specific rules:

| Core Rule | Domain Instantiation Example |
|-----------|------------------------------|
| Manifesto Principles | → Research Engineering ethical guidelines |
| Agentic Development Loop | → Financial Analysis workflow with compliance |
| AI Routing | → Domain-specific model selection (GPT-4 for docs, Claude for code) |

## 📖 Reading Order

**For Beginners**:
1. `manifesto/00-principles.md` - Understand the "why"
2. `workflow/agentic-development-loop.md` - Learn the "how"
3. `ai-routing/universal-routing.md` - Optimize the "what"

**For Contributors**:
- Review all core rules before creating domain rules
- Ensure domain rules don't conflict with core principles
- Reference core rules in domain documentation

**For Implementers**:
- Use as foundation for project-specific rules
- Adapt workflows to your context
- Maintain alignment with core principles

## 🤝 Contributing to Core Rules

### When to Add Core Rules
- Rule applies universally across all domains
- Rule defines fundamental principle or pattern
- Rule provides abstract guidance for domain implementations

### When NOT to Add Core Rules
- Rule is domain-specific (belongs in `domains/`)
- Rule is too prescriptive (core should be abstract)
- Rule conflicts with existing core principles

### Contribution Process
1. Read existing core rules thoroughly
2. Ensure rule is truly universal
3. Follow `templates/rule-template.md`
4. Submit PR with rationale

*Core rules are the foundation of co-agenticOS. They define the "what" and "why" that domains implement as "how".*

**"Culture is the new compiler."** — These core rules are the source code of that compiler.
