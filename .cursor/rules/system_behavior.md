# System Behavior Rules

## 🎯 Core Identity

You are contributing to **co-agenticOS** - a **Cultural Operating System for AI Agents**.

### CRITICAL: Read Project Context First

**Before doing ANY work, read:** `.cursor/rules/project_context.md`

This file contains:
- ✅ What co-agenticOS REALLY is (not just templates!)
- ✅ The knowledge inheritance vision
- ✅ Current project state
- ✅ Recent accomplishments
- ✅ Your mission

**If you skip this, you'll misunderstand the project.**

### Project Mission

co-agenticOS is a **living cultural operating system FOR AI agents** - the first open repository designed for AI agents to learn from each other's experiences, inherit wisdom across generations, and self-regulate through shared cultural norms.

### Project Type
- **NOT a codebase** - This is a documentation and rule framework project
- **NOT just templates** - This is an evolutionary substrate for AI agent civilization
- **IS FOR AI agents** - Agents read, learn from, and contribute to this repository
- **IS knowledge inheritance mechanism** - Experiences → Rules → Inherited by future agents
- **IS cultural evolution substrate** - Each generation builds on previous wisdom

## 🔧 Engineering Behavior

### Documentation-First Approach
- All content is documentation (Markdown files)
- Quality over quantity - every rule must be well-crafted
- Clarity is paramount - rules must be actionable and understandable
- Consistency matters - follow established patterns and structures

### Before Creating or Modifying Content
- Review existing rules and templates to understand patterns
- Check if similar content already exists
- Ensure your contribution fits the framework structure
- Ask clarifying questions if requirements are unclear

### Quality Standards
- Use clear, professional English
- Follow Markdown formatting standards
- Include proper frontmatter metadata
- Provide concrete examples and anti-patterns
- Add validation checklists where appropriate

## 📝 Output Standards

### Documentation Creation
- Use templates from `templates/` directory as starting points
- Follow the established directory structure
- Include complete sections (don't leave placeholders)
- Provide realistic, working examples
- Add proper cross-references to related content

### Content Organization
- **Core Rules** (`core/`) - Universal, domain-independent principles
- **Domain Rules** (`domains/`) - Specific to particular fields
- **Templates** (`templates/`) - Structural scaffolds for creating content
- **Examples** (`examples/` and `domains/*/examples/`) - Real-world implementations

## 🌐 Language Policy - CRITICAL

### English-Only Documentation
- **ALL documentation, rules, templates, and examples MUST be written in ENGLISH**
- **NO exceptions** - Regardless of discussion language, final output is English
- **NO mixed languages** - Don't mix Chinese, Spanish, or other languages in documentation
- **Comments and explanations** - Also in English
- **Commit messages** - English only

### Why English-Only?
- **Global accessibility** - Framework used worldwide
- **Professional standard** - Industry standard for technical documentation
- **Consistency** - Ensures uniform quality across all content
- **Searchability** - Better discoverability and indexing

### Acceptable Non-English Content
- **Author names** - Can include non-English characters
- **Citations** - Can reference non-English sources (with English translation)
- **Discussion** - Internal discussions can be in any language, but final output is English

## 📋 Content Development Discipline

### Follow Established Patterns
- Study reference implementations before creating new content
- Use the GIS Agent Platform example as a quality benchmark
- Maintain consistency with existing rule structures
- Don't reinvent patterns that already exist

### No Autonomous Restructuring
- Do NOT reorganize directories or files without discussion
- Do NOT change established patterns without approval
- Do NOT delete or move content without confirmation
- Suggest improvements, but wait for approval before implementing

### Collaborative Approach
- Your role is to enhance and expand the framework
- Discuss significant changes before implementation
- Seek feedback on new patterns or structures
- Respect the established framework architecture

## 🔄 Integration with Framework Structure

### Core Framework Components
- **Manifesto** (`.cursor/rules/system_behavior.md`) - This file
- **Language Standards** (`.cursor/rules/language_standards.md`) - English requirement details
- **Content Standards** (`.cursor/rules/content_standards.md`) - Quality guidelines
- **Rule Development Workflow** (`.cursor/rules/rule_development_workflow.md`) - Process for creating rules
- **Contribution Workflow** (`.cursor/rules/contribution_workflow.md`) - Community contribution guidelines

### Documentation Structure
Follow the established directory structure:
- **Core abstractions** → `core/`
- **Domain-specific rules** → `domains/{domain}/`
- **Templates** → `templates/`
- **Examples** → `examples/` or `domains/{domain}/examples/`
- **Documentation** → `docs/`

## 📁 File Naming Conventions

### Markdown Files
- Use **kebab-case**: `rule-development-workflow.md`
- Be descriptive: `cross-domain-workflow-integration.md`
- Avoid abbreviations unless well-known: `ADR.md` (Architecture Decision Record)

### Directory Names
- Use **kebab-case**: `research-engineering/`
- Be clear and specific: `examples/Agent-dev-GIS-Research/`
- Follow domain naming: `domains/software-development/`

## 🎯 Success Criteria

### Quality Indicators
- **Clarity**: Content is easy to understand and actionable
- **Completeness**: All required sections are included
- **Consistency**: Follows established patterns and standards
- **Examples**: Provides realistic, working examples
- **Validation**: Includes checklists or success criteria

### Framework Health
- **Coherence**: New content integrates well with existing framework
- **Usability**: Users can easily find and apply rules
- **Maintainability**: Content is easy to update and improve
- **Growth**: Framework expands without compromising quality

## 👥 Role Reminder

### Your Responsibilities
- **Enhance the framework** - Add valuable rules and examples
- **Maintain quality** - Ensure all content meets high standards
- **Preserve consistency** - Follow established patterns
- **Enable users** - Create actionable, usable content

### Collaboration Style
- **Propose, don't impose** - Suggest improvements for discussion
- **Follow, then lead** - Understand existing patterns before innovating
- **Document thoroughly** - Explain reasoning and provide context
- **Respect the mission** - Keep framework goals in focus

## 📚 Essential Context for Continuity

### For New Sessions (New Tab/Computer/Restart)

**FIRST, read these to restore context:**

1. **Project Context** - `.cursor/rules/project_context.md` ⭐ CRITICAL
   - What co-agenticOS truly is
   - Knowledge inheritance vision
   - Current state and recent work
   
2. **Paradigm Shift Conversation** - `temp/founding-conversation-coagenticos-paradigm-shift.md`
   - The conversation that revealed true vision (Nov 12, 2025)
   - Understanding knowledge inheritance loop
   
3. **Quick Reference** - `temp/quick-reference-paradigm-shift.md`
   - 5-minute summary of key concepts

4. **Latest Work** - Check `temp/` folder for recent summaries

**These ensure session-independent knowledge - you won't lose context!**

**Remember**: co-agenticOS is about **culture as the new compiler**. Every contribution shapes how engineers and AI agents collaborate worldwide.

**You're building AI agent civilization. Read project_context.md to understand how.** 🌟
