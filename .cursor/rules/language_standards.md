## 📝 Writing Guidelines

### Use Clear, Professional English
- **Be concise and direct** - Avoid unnecessary complexity
- **Use standard terminology** - Industry-standard technical terms
- **Write in active voice** - "AI generates code" not "Code is generated by AI"
- **Be specific and actionable** - "Use kebab-case for file names" not "Name files appropriately"

### Grammar and Style
- **Use proper grammar** - Check spelling and grammar
- **Consistent terminology** - Use the same terms throughout
- **Proper capitalization** - Follow standard English capitalization rules
- **Professional tone** - Technical but accessible writing style

### Technical Writing Standards
- **Define acronyms** - First use: "Architecture Decision Record (ADR)"
- **Use examples** - Show, don't just tell
- **Structure clearly** - Use headings, lists, and formatting
- **Cross-reference** - Link to related content when relevant

## 🔄 Workflow for Non-English Speakers

2. **Content creation** - Write in English (use translation tools if needed)
3. **Review and refinement** - Ensure English quality
4. **Commit** - English commit message
5. **Pull request** - English PR description

### Translation Tools
- **Acceptable to use** - AI translation tools (ChatGPT, DeepL, Google Translate)
- **Must review** - Always review and refine AI translations
- **Natural English** - Ensure it reads naturally, not machine-translated
- **Technical accuracy** - Verify technical terms are correct

### Getting Help
- **Ask for review** - Request English language review if unsure
