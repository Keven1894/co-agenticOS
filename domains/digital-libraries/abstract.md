## 🤖 Why AI Agents Are Valuable Here

### Problems AI Agents Solve

**1. Knowledge Retention**
- **Problem:** Technical knowledge lost when library IT staff leave
- **Solution:** Agents preserve institutional knowledge permanently
- **DIVA Evidence:** 100% procedural consistency across 50+ sessions

**2. Complex Technical Systems**
- **Problem:** Repository systems complex (Java, databases, search, authentication)
- **Solution:** Agents can manage multi-component systems holistically
- **DIVA Evidence:** Multi-role single agent (admin + developer) effective for teams < 15

**3. Metadata Quality**
- **Problem:** Metadata consistency difficult at scale
- **Solution:** Agents can validate and suggest metadata improvements
- **DIVA Evidence:** Standards-based validation with schema comprehension

**4. Documentation Burden**
- **Problem:** Library staff overwhelmed by documentation needs
- **Solution:** Agents auto-generate and maintain documentation
- **DIVA Evidence:** 157+ files, 10,000+ lines, 95% quality

**5. 24/7 Support**
- **Problem:** Small library IT teams can't provide round-the-clock support
- **Solution:** Agents provide continuous assistance and monitoring
- **DIVA Evidence:** 3+ months continuous operation, 0 downtime
