- **AI Role**: Generate technical solution design and risk assessment
- **Output**: Comprehensive project plan with timestamped documentation

### Phase 2: Implementation & Execution
- **Human Role**: Review AI-generated plans, approve technical approaches, monitor progress
- **AI Role**: Execute implementation according to approved plan, generate code and documentation
- **Output**: Implemented features with step-by-step verification

### Phase 3: Completion & Documentation
- **Human Role**: Verify functionality, review results, approve completion
- **AI Role**: Generate comprehensive execution logs and technical documentation
- **Output**: Complete implementation with detailed execution records

### Phase 4: Knowledge Integration
- **Human Role**: Review accumulated development logs, integrate insights into architecture
- **AI Role**: Consolidate multiple implementations, generate development summaries
- **Output**: Updated system documentation and architectural insights

## 📘 Example

### Project: GIS Agent Platform Development
**Context**: Building a comprehensive GIS research platform with AI agent integration

**Human-AI Collaboration**:
1. **Human**: Defined platform requirements for GIS data processing and AI agent management
2. **AI**: Generated technical architecture and implementation plan with risk assessment
3. **Human**: Reviewed and approved the comprehensive plan with specific milestones
4. **AI**: Implemented system behavior rules, development workflow, and documentation standards
5. **Human**: Validated implementation against requirements and conducted quality assurance
6. **AI**: Generated execution logs, development summaries, and architectural documentation

**Key Features Implemented**:
- **System Behavior Rules**: Environment variable safety, language policy, engineering standards
- **Development Workflow**: Four-phase lifecycle with strict documentation separation
- **Code Standards**: Comprehensive formatting, testing, and quality requirements
- **Project Management**: Task coordination, milestone tracking, and progress monitoring
- **Documentation Standards**: Complete documentation structure and quality guidelines

**Outputs**:
- Complete GIS agent platform with modular rule system
- Comprehensive documentation lifecycle (plans → sum-logs → dev-logs → architecture)
- Automated configuration management and quality assurance
- Reusable templates and standards for future projects

## 🚨 Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### 1. Skipping Documentation Phases
- **Problem**: Implementing without proper planning or documentation
- **Solution**: Enforce four-phase lifecycle with quality gates
- **Prevention**: Clear documentation requirements and approval processes

### 2. Modifying Original Plans
- **Problem**: Changing approved plans during execution
- **Solution**: Keep original plans unchanged, create separate execution logs
- **Prevention**: Clear separation between planning and execution documents

### 3. Incomplete Knowledge Integration
- **Problem**: Not consolidating development insights into architecture
- **Solution**: Regular development log creation and architecture updates
- **Prevention**: Scheduled knowledge integration cycles

### 4. Quality Compromise for Speed
- **Problem**: Sacrificing quality standards for faster delivery
- **Solution**: Enforce quality gates at each phase
- **Prevention**: Clear quality standards and validation requirements
