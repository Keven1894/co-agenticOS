- **AI Role**: Execute data transformations and generate processing code
- **Output**: Processed dataset with complete processing log

### 3. Post-Processing Verification
- **Human Role**: Review results and validate scientific accuracy
- **AI Role**: Generate verification reports and quality metrics
- **Output**: Verified dataset with comprehensive documentation

### 4. Documentation Generation
- **Human Role**: Review and approve documentation
- **AI Role**: Generate processing documentation and metadata
- **Output**: Complete processing documentation

## 📘 Example

### Dataset: Coral Reef Drone Imagery
**Context**: Processing 10TB of drone imagery for coral reef health analysis

**Human-AI Collaboration**:
1. **Human**: Defines image quality standards and processing requirements
2. **AI**: Analyzes image quality and identifies processing needs
3. **Human**: Reviews AI analysis and approves processing approach
4. **AI**: Implements image processing pipeline with human oversight
5. **Human**: Validates processed images and scientific accuracy
6. **AI**: Generates processing documentation and quality reports

**Outputs**:
- Processed imagery dataset (8TB)
- Processing log with all transformations
- Quality assessment report
- Metadata with provenance information
