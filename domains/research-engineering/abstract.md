# Research Engineering Domain Rules
### Abstract: Human-AI Collaboration in Research Engineering

## Domain Definition

Research Engineering encompasses the application of engineering principles to research processes, including data collection, processing, analysis, and validation. This domain focuses on creating reproducible, scalable, and reliable research workflows through human-AI collaboration.

## Core Principles

### 1. Reproducibility First
- All research processes must be reproducible
- AI assistance should enhance, not replace, scientific rigor
- Documentation is integral to the research process

### 2. Data Integrity
- Data quality is paramount in all research activities
- AI tools must maintain data provenance and lineage
- Validation and verification are mandatory at each step

### 3. Transparent Methodology
- AI-assisted decisions must be explainable and documented
- Research methodologies should be clear and auditable
- Human oversight is required for all critical decisions

### 4. Continuous Learning
- Research processes should improve through iteration
- AI assistance should adapt to research needs
- Knowledge should be captured and shared

## Common Patterns

### 1. Data Processing Pipeline
- **Input Validation**: Verify data quality and completeness
- **Processing**: Apply transformations with AI assistance
- **Output Validation**: Ensure results meet quality standards
- **Documentation**: Record all processing steps and decisions

### 2. Experimental Design
- **Hypothesis Formation**: Use AI for literature review and hypothesis generation
- **Method Selection**: AI-assisted method comparison and selection
- **Implementation**: Human-AI collaborative implementation
- **Analysis**: AI-assisted data analysis with human interpretation

### 3. Quality Assurance
- **Automated Checks**: AI-powered quality validation
- **Human Review**: Mandatory human review of critical results
- **Peer Review**: Collaborative review processes
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive process documentation

## Success Metrics

### Quantitative Metrics
- **Reproducibility Rate**: Percentage of reproducible experiments
- **Data Quality Score**: Measured data quality metrics
- **Processing Efficiency**: Time and resource utilization
- **Error Rate**: Frequency of errors in research processes

### Qualitative Metrics
- **Research Impact**: Quality and significance of research outputs
- **Collaboration Effectiveness**: Human-AI collaboration quality
- **Knowledge Transfer**: Effectiveness of knowledge sharing
- **Innovation**: Novel approaches and discoveries

## Related Domains
