# Getting Started with co-agenticOS
### Your Journey into Human-AI Collaboration

Welcome to **co-agenticOS** — the culture of AI-involved software engineering. This guide will help you transform your development workflow into a collaborative partnership between humans and AI agents.

## 🚀 Quick Start (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Set Up Your Environment
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/co-agenticOS.git
cd co-agenticOS

# Install dependencies
pnpm install
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set up Cursor rules
cp workflow/cursor-rules.md .cursor/rules.md
```

### Step 2: Create Your First Plan
```bash
# Copy the plan template
cp templates/PLAN.md plans/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)-PLAN.md

# Edit your plan for today
# Focus on 2-3 primary objectives
# Assign specific tasks to AI agents
```

### Step 3: Start Your First Loop
1. **Open Cursor IDE** with your project
2. **Begin implementation** using AI assistance
3. **Document AI collaboration** in real-time
4. **End with a summary** using our templates

## 🧩 Core Concepts

### The Co-Agentic Flywheel
The continuous loop of Plan → Implement → Refactor → Summarize creates momentum and learning:

```
Plan (AI drafts, Human refines)
    ↓
Implement (Human-AI co-edit)
    ↓
Refactor (AI suggests, Human approves)
    ↓
Summarize (AI documents, Human reflects)
    ↓
[Loop continues...]
```

### AI Agent Roles
- **Code Generation Agent:** Implements features and fixes
- **Documentation Agent:** Creates and maintains documentation
- **Review Agent:** Analyzes code quality and suggests improvements
- **Planning Agent:** Helps with strategic planning and task breakdown

### Cultural Principles
1. **Co-Creation over Automation** — AI as collaborator, not replacement
2. **Transparency over Speed** — Every AI action is explainable
3. **Continuous Reflection** — Every iteration includes learning
4. **Culture-Driven Development** — Shared values drive quality

## 📋 Daily Workflow

### Morning (15 minutes)
1. **Review yesterday's summary**
2. **Create today's plan** using PLAN.md template
3. **Assign AI agent focus areas**
4. **Set success metrics**

### During Development (4-6 hours)
1. **Use AI for code generation** in Cursor
2. **Document AI assistance** in real-time
3. **Review AI suggestions** before implementing
4. **Maintain continuous human oversight**

### End of Day (15 minutes)
1. **Generate daily summary** using Summary.md template
2. **Reflect on AI collaboration** effectiveness
3. **Plan tomorrow's focus** areas
4. **Update project documentation**
