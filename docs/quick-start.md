# Quick Start Guide

Welcome to Engineer Agentic AI! This guide will help you get started with using AI agent rules and workflows for your development projects.

## 🚀 5-Minute Setup

### Step 1: Choose Your Rules
Start by selecting the rules that match your project type:

**For Web Development:**
- `rules/general/core-rules.md` - Core principles
- `rules/domain-specific/web-development.md` - Web-specific guidelines
- `rules/general/cursor-config.md` - Cursor IDE configuration

**For Frontend Development:**
- `agents/frontend/frontend-agent.md` - Specialized frontend agent
- `rules/domain-specific/web-development.md` - Frontend-specific rules

**For General Development:**
- `rules/general/core-rules.md` - Universal guidelines
- `workflows/development/standard-workflow.md` - Development process

### Step 2: Set Up Your Workflow
Follow the standard development workflow:

1. **Planning Phase**: Define requirements and technical design
2. **Implementation Phase**: Generate and review code with AI
3. **Testing Phase**: Create and execute tests
4. **Documentation Phase**: Generate documentation
5. **Deployment Phase**: Prepare and execute deployment

### Step 3: Configure Your AI Agent
Choose the appropriate agent configuration:

**Frontend Agent** (`agents/frontend/frontend-agent.md`):
- React/Vue/Angular component generation
- State management patterns
- Performance optimization
- Accessibility compliance

**General Agent** (`rules/general/core-rules.md`):
- Code quality standards
- Security best practices
- Testing requirements
- Documentation standards

## 📋 Essential Rules Checklist

Before starting any project, ensure you follow these core principles:

### Code Quality
- [ ] Write clean, readable, and maintainable code
- [ ] Follow established coding conventions
- [ ] Include appropriate comments and documentation
- [ ] Use meaningful variable and function names
- [ ] Implement proper error handling

### Security
- [ ] Never hardcode sensitive information
- [ ] Validate all inputs and sanitize data
- [ ] Use secure communication protocols
- [ ] Implement proper authentication and authorization
- [ ] Follow OWASP security guidelines

### Testing
- [ ] Write unit tests for critical functionality
- [ ] Include integration tests for API endpoints
- [ ] Implement proper test coverage
- [ ] Use descriptive test names and assertions
- [ ] Maintain test data consistency

## 🎯 Common Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Creating a New React Component

**Prompt Example:**
```
Using the frontend agent rules, create a React TypeScript component for a user profile card that:
- Displays user name, email, and avatar
- Has edit and delete functionality
- Follows accessibility guidelines
- Includes proper error handling
- Uses the established component patterns
```

**Expected Output:**
- TypeScript interface for props
- Functional component with hooks
- Proper error boundaries
- ARIA attributes for accessibility
- Unit tests for the component

### Use Case 2: Setting Up a New Project

**Prompt Example:**
```
Using the project setup example, create a new React TypeScript project with:
- Express backend API
- User authentication
- Database integration
- Testing setup
- Deployment configuration
```

**Expected Output:**
- Complete project structure
- Package.json configurations
- TypeScript setup
- Testing framework
- Deployment scripts

### Use Case 3: Code Review with AI

**Prompt Example:**
```
Review this code using the core rules and suggest improvements for:
- Code quality and maintainability
- Security vulnerabilities
- Performance optimizations
- Testing coverage
- Documentation completeness
```

**Expected Output:**
- Specific improvement suggestions
- Security issue identification
- Performance optimization recommendations
- Test coverage analysis
- Documentation improvements

## 🔧 Customization

### Creating Custom Rules

1. **Use the Template**: Start with `rules/templates/rule-template.md`
2. **Define Scope**: Specify what the rule covers
3. **Add Examples**: Include good and bad examples
4. **Create Checklist**: Add validation criteria
5. **Test Examples**: Ensure all examples work

### Modifying Existing Rules

1. **Review Current Rule**: Understand the existing structure
2. **Identify Changes**: Determine what needs updating
3. **Follow Patterns**: Maintain consistent formatting
4. **Update Examples**: Ensure examples reflect changes
5. **Test Thoroughly**: Verify all modifications work
